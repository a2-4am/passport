; Text can contain substitution strings, which
; are replaced by current values at runtime. Each
; substitution string is two bytes long. The first
; byte is always "%", which puts the print routine
; into substitution mode. The next byte controls
; which value is printed (see list below), then
; substitution mode ends automatically. Unknown
; substitution strings are silently ignored and
; produce no output.
;
; Substitution strings are case-sensitive.
;
; Supported substitution strings:
;   %S  destination (write) slot
;   %D  destination (write) drive
;   %t  current track (during read and patch)
;   %s  current sector (during read)
;
; In addition, it supports "%0" through "%9"
; for printing arbitrary hexadecimal values.
; These are stored in the gDisplayBytes array and
; can be set directly before calling PrintByID.
