# Passport
a verification and copy program for
5.25-inch Apple II floppy disks

Minimum system requirements:
- Apple //e, //c, IIgs, or ][+ with 64K
- Two 5.25-inch disk drives(*)

(*) fully compatible with floppy drive
emulators like CFFA3000 and FloppyEMU.

## Some fun facts about copy protection

1. Many companies, especially smaller
   ones, outsourced their protection.
   I have seen byte-for-byte identical
   copy protection on disks from seven
   different companies!

2. Even companies that wrote their own
   copy protection would try to re-use
   it on multiple disks to get the most
   "bang for the buck."

3. Not everything has been cracked!
   Because there was so much piracy in
   the 1980s, some people assume that
   everything ever published has been
   cracked, digitized, and preserved in
   an emulator-friendly format. In
   reality, there are hundreds of disks
   that have never been cracked. Thirty
   years later, these programs are
   still trapped on physical media,
   literally rotting away.

## Usage

Using Passport is simple. After running
the program, put an original disk in
slot 6, drive 1 and a blank formatted
disk in any other drive. If necessary,
press "S" to cycle through your drives.
Then press "C" to start the cracking.

If all goes well, Passport will read
your original disk and write a copy in
a standard format, then remove any
protection checks from the copy. The
copy will boot and run just as well as
the original disk, but it will be
copyable with COPYA or any full-disk
copy program.

If all does not go well, Passport will
tell you where it all went wrong.

In any case, Passport will NEVER write
to or alter your original disk in any
way. And neither should you! Don't
reduce the number of original disks in
the world; they aren't making any more
of them.

During crack processing, you can hit
the `ESC` key to stop.  Whether the
crack completes because it finished
successfully or not, you can retry the
samenthing again by hitting the `2`
key, or retry with ignoring errors
with the key combination `CTRL-R`.

Passport targets common protection
schemes that were reused by multiple
companies. These types of protection
were common in educational software.

Passport can also recognize and defeat
the copy protection used by some game
companies. In general there was more
variation and "one-off" protection in
games than in educational software, so
your mileage may vary.
